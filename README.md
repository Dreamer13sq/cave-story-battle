# Cave Story Battle
A fighting game prototype featuring characters from Daisuke Amaya's Cave Story.  
Developed in hopes of understanding the foundations and nuances to creating a fighting game to make an original title in the future.

Game developed in Game Maker Studio 2.  
Models made in Blender.  
Sprites made in Aseprite.  

I do not own anything related to Cave Story.
